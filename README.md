# IoT Assignment: AcLAB 3D Printing Filament Dryer
## IoT Solution based on Core IoT platform.

### Devices in the System
- **LCD 16x2 Display**  
  Used to show real-time temperature, humidity, filament information, and system status.

- **DHT20 Sensor**  
  Measures temperature and humidity inside the dryer chamber.

- **Fan**  
  Regulates airflow and assists in controlling the drying temperature.

- **Heater (Relay Controlled)**  
  Provides heat to dry the filament, controlled based on sensor feedback.

- **RFID Reader**  
  Used for user management and to save filament type and color information via RFID cards.

- **Buzzer/Alarm**  
  Alerts users to abnormal conditions (e.g., over-temperature, drying complete).

- **Microcontroller (Yolo Uno)**  
  Core controller for all devices and IoT features.
